# Sandwich Club

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Android Developer Nanodegree on **Udacity**.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## Criteria met:
- JSON data is parsed correctly to a Sandwich object in JsonUtils
- JSON is parsed without using 3rd party libraries
- DetailActivity shows all Sandwich details correctly
- Detail layout includes a ScrollView so all the details are visible in small screen devices
- Sandwich details are shown in a sensible layout. For example, ingredients appear next to the ingredients label
